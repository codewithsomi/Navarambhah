# SUN397Vision: Deep Scene UNderstanding



Brief Description:
Scene categorization is a fundamental problem in computer vision. By “scene” we mean a place in which a human can act within, or a place to which a human being could navigate. The SUN397 Dataset is a large-scale image dataset designed for scene understanding in computer vision. It contains 15 distinct classes with a total of 130,519 images, covering 397 well-sampled categories. This dataset is already splitted into train, valid and test. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in scene understanding.
